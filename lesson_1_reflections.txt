How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
there was a minute typo so seeing the difference between two versions helped a lot


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
going back to previous cersions would be lot easier if the new version breaksdown


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros
seems logical
too many pros to describe
cons
one could go on for too long without committing or one could commit too often


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
most of the google docs are irrelevant to each other while the code to one file generally affects other files too


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log lists the history of commits made and we can use git diff to compare any two commits


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
